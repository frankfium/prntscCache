Opens random Prnt.sc screenshots 
===============================
<p>There is a growing trend on the internet to open prnt.sc and add two random letters and 4 random numbers to the end of the url<br>
i.e(prnt.sc/aa1111)</p>
This will bring up an image attached to that handle.<br>
This code generates a random url extension multiple times, checks if the screenshot was deleted, and opens the screenshots in the user's browser.
